/* The two questions, asked separately.

   One button used to be both: press it once and it checked, press the same
   button again and it signed. The words changed but the button did not move,
   and the second press is the one that spends money. A confirmation someone
   can walk into by pressing twice is not a confirmation.

   So the check stays on the screen and the signature moves into a panel that
   has to be opened, read and answered - with what is being paid, what comes
   back at worst, and a way out that is the same size as the way in. */
